# Comp541FinalProject

For my final project of Machine Learning course, i will replicate the paper, named Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.

Paper: Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala, 2016, Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016 

Link of Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434

Summary: In this paper, they introduce deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for unsupervised representation learning. They evaluate a set of constraints on the architectural topology of the network to overcome the problem of instability. They use the trained discriminators for image classification tasks and they show that the generators have interesting vector arithmetic properties allowing for easy manipulation of many semantic qualities of generated samples.
